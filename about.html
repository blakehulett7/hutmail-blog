    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I currently serve as the Majority Leader of the FireHouse. I serve at the behest of the Elephant-Rhino party. You
        can find our platform at at the ERP website. Our top priorities are preservation of FireTradition, national
        security, and aggressive economic policy. We want the FireNation to remain the world superpower and be ready to
        step in to a peacekeeper role in the event that the Avatar abdicates.</p>
