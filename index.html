        <h2 class="post-title">On Reparations to the Earth Kingdom</h2>
        <h3 class="post-date">December 3, 2025</h3>
        <p class="post-text">We do not owe the Earth Kingdom anything. They fought hard, but lost.</p>
        <p class="post-text">We are not responsible for the atrocities of our ancestors, the world was a much different
            place in the past.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">Tax Cuts Incoming</h2>
        <h3 class="post-date">December 4, 2025</h3>
        <p class="post-text">I can confidently report that we have the votes in the house for the latest round of tax
            cuts.</p>
        <p class="post-text">This will ignite our economy and ensure prosperity for all.</p>

        <h3 class="post-date">December 5, 2025</h3>
        <p class="post-text">I am very happy to inform that we have a new Fire Flakes vendor in our prestigous courtyard
            named Lee. Stop by and say hello.</p>

        <h3 class="post-date">December 6, 2025</h3>
        <p class="post-text">This is a reminder to all house representatives that the vote on FHB-115R will begin
            tonight at 8.</p>

        <h2 class="post-title">Naval Security Act</h2>
        <h3 class="post-date">December 7, 2025</h3>
        <p class="post-text">I fully endorse the recently proposed Naval Security Act.</p>
        <p class="post-text">There shouldn't be much resistance in the house when it comes to the floor, but my
            collegues in the FireSenate seem a bit skeptical of its prospects there.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Without a strong Naval presence, our influence would be greatly diminished in the world.
        </p>
        <p class="post-text">Additionally, Avatar Korra seems increasingly distant from world affairs lately, so it
            seems naive to turn over our security interests to her. Maybe Tenzen will have word on that at our next
            meeting.</p>
